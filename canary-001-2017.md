# Namecoin Canary #1

## Statements

The Namecoin developers who have digitally signed this file [1] state the following:

1. The date of issue of this canary is December 3, 2017.
2. No warrants have ever been served to us with regard to Namecoin (e.g. to hand out the private signing keys or to introduce backdoors).
3. We plan to publish the next of these canary statements in the first two weeks of March 2018. Special note should be taken if no new canary is published by that time or if the list of statements changes without plausible explanation.

## Special announcements

None.

## Disclaimers and notes

This canary scheme is not infallible. Although signing the declaration makes it very difficult for a third party to produce arbitrary declarations, it does not prevent them from using force or other means, like blackmail or compromising the signers' laptops, to coerce us to produce false declarations.

The news feeds quoted below (Proof of freshness) serves to demonstrate that this canary could not have been created prior to the date stated.  It shows that a series of canaries was not created in advance.

This declaration is merely a best effort and is provided without any guarantee or warranty. It is not legally binding in any way to anybody. None of the signers should be ever held legally responsible for any of the statements made here.
