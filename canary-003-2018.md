# Namecoin Canary #3

## Statements

The Namecoin developers who have digitally signed this file [1] state the following:

1. The date of issue of this canary is June 15, 2018.
2. No warrants, subpoenas, national security letters, or government-issued gag orders have ever been served to us with regard to Namecoin (e.g. to hand out the private signing keys or to introduce backdoors), except as described in the "List of incidents" below.
3. We plan to publish the next of these canary statements in the first two weeks of September 2018. Special note should be taken if no new canary is published by that time or if the list of statements changes without plausible explanation.

## Special announcements

None.

## List of incidents

1. Aaron Rich (alleged DNC leak source and brother of murdered alleged DNC leak source Seth Rich) apparently [filed a subpoena](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180609/13541040000/attorneys-seth-rich-linked-defamation-case-demand-identifying-info-thousands-twitter-users-updated.shtml) against Twitter on June 1, 2018, demanding private information from a set of Twitter accounts that includes @Namecoin and at least one of our developers.  Techdirt reports that the subpoena has since been withdrawn by Rich.

## Disclaimers and notes

This canary scheme is not infallible. Although signing the declaration makes it very difficult for a third party to produce arbitrary declarations, it does not prevent them from using force or other means, like blackmail or compromising the signers' laptops, to coerce us to produce false declarations.

The news feeds quoted below (Proof of freshness) serves to demonstrate that this canary could not have been created prior to the date stated.  It shows that a series of canaries was not created in advance.

This declaration is merely a best effort and is provided without any guarantee or warranty. It is not legally binding in any way to anybody. None of the signers should be ever held legally responsible for any of the statements made here.
